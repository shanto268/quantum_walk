Chapter 1:
> Heidelberg Multi- Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) package
> MCTDH can be seen as an algorithm to solve the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation (i.e. to propagate wavepackets) for mul- tidimensional dynamical systems consisting of distinguishable particles 

Chapter 2:
> Reviews QM1 and QM2 stuff
I need to review Griffith's for stronger grasp on the content
